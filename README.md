iCharge- A one stop solution for all your Charging needs (my EV Charging Station Project)

Problem:- Electric Vehicles are increasing day by day in India. It is expected that there would be more than 50 Million 2-Wheeler EV and 20 Million 4-Wheeler Electric vehicle will run on Indian roads till year 2025. And these vehicles, Have to get charged at the charging stations - It takes apx. 30 mins minimum to get full charge in one of the fastest charging ports other than that it takes more than 1 hours to get full charge to any of the Electric Vehicle.

Solution:- We have came with the solution of iCharge- EV Charging station. Where, You can see how many cars are present at a specific charging station near you, also you can get nevigation to that location and even you can book time-slot for charging your vehicle in advance at different charging stations near you. We have used Google Maps Api for locating different charging stations and we will use computer vision technology camera at each station to check how many vehicles are in queue for charging.

Tech Stacks used:- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, GOOGLE Maps API, Javascript and Mysql database for user data.

Front-end Part:- This project is made through HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the frontend part. You haave to download whole project to see frontend part. We have shared some screenshorts of Project below.

Backend:- We have used Google maps API for navigating to the nearest charging station and as of now we have used random numbers through Rand() function for no of charging ports and no of vehicles in queue. We will use actual data of cars when we can partner with the charging stations.
